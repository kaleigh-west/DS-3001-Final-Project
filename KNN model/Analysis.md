# KNN Model Analysis for Obesity Dataset

## Introduction

This document presents the results and insights from the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classification approach applied to the obesity dataset. The analysis focuses on predicting obesity levels using various features related to eating habits, physical condition, and lifestyle factors.

## Methodology

### Dataset Overview
The analysis was performed on the UCI ML Repository obesity dataset containing:
- Demographic information (age, gender, height, weight)
- Eating habits (meal frequency, caloric food consumption, water intake)
- Physical activity levels
- Lifestyle factors

### Preprocessing
1. **Data Cleaning**
   - No missing values were found in the dataset
   - All features were converted to appropriate data types

2. **Feature Engineering**
   - Gender encoded as binary (Female: 1, Male: 0)
   - Categorical variables encoded:
     - Family history with overweight (yes: 1, no: 0)
     - FAVC (yes: 1, no: 0)
     - CAEC (no: 0, Sometimes: 1, Frequently: 2, Always: 3)
     - SMOKE (yes: 1, no: 0)
     - SCC (yes: 1, no: 0)
     - CALC (no: 0, Sometimes: 1, Frequently: 2, Always: 3)
   - MTRANS one-hot encoded

3. **Data Scaling**
   - Standard scaling applied to normalize features
   - MinMax scaling applied after standardization
   - Both X (features) and y (target) were scaled

### Model Development
- Binary classification approach (Obese vs Non-obese)
- Train-test split: 80-20 ratio
- Cross-validation used for model evaluation
- Hyperparameter tuning through grid search

## Key Findings

### Model Performance
- The KNN model achieved consistent performance across different evaluation metrics
- Cross-validation helped ensure robust model evaluation
- Model showed good generalization on unseen data

### Feature Importance
Based on the model's behavior, the following features showed significant influence:
1. Weight and Height (BMI components)
2. Physical activity frequency (FAF)
3. Eating habits (FAVC, FCVC)
4. Family history with overweight

### Model Limitations
1. Sensitivity to feature scaling
2. Computational intensity with large datasets
3. Need for careful feature preprocessing

## Practical Implications

1. **Prediction Capability**
   - Model can effectively identify obesity risk
   - Useful for early intervention screening

2. **Feature Importance**
   - Highlights key factors contributing to obesity
   - Can guide prevention strategies

3. **Clinical Application**
   - Tool for healthcare providers
   - Support for patient risk assessment

## Conclusion

The KNN model provides a reliable approach for obesity prediction based on lifestyle and physical factors. Its performance suggests it can be a valuable tool for healthcare providers in identifying individuals at risk of obesity. The model's insights about feature importance align with clinical understanding of obesity risk factors.

## Future Work

1. **Model Enhancement**
   - Experiment with different distance metrics
   - Explore feature selection techniques
   - Implement ensemble methods

2. **Application Development**
   - Create user-friendly interface
